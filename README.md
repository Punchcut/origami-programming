Unfolding the Art of Code with Origami Studio
====

For designers interested in using code as a creative tool, Origami makes it possible to learn core programming concepts visually.

This repository contains a set of Origami Studio lesson files for showing UI designers the fundamentals of programming. The lessons use universal programming concepts to build a world clock app across a series of Origami Studio files. Each file focuses on a single programming concept, with comment patches to explain its effect on the app.
